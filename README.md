# 🔒 Security Investigation Automation System

**Comprehensive, automated security investigations powered by Microsoft Sentinel, Defender XDR, Graph API, and threat intelligence — with 21 specialized Agent Skills**

> 📺 **Video Walkthrough:** See this project in action — [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3UFqWA4cmoE?t=1470) (starts at the Security Investigator demo). Covers the end-to-end workflow: natural language investigations, MCP server integration, KQL query execution, threat intelligence enrichment, and automated report generation.

An investigation automation framework that combines **GitHub Copilot**, **VS Code Agent Skills**, and **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** to enable natural language security investigations. Ask questions like *"Investigate this user for the last 7 days"* or *"Is this IP malicious?"* and get comprehensive analysis with KQL queries, threat intelligence correlation, and professional reports.

### Quick Start (TL;DR)

```powershell
# 1. Clone and open in VS Code
git clone https://github.com/SCStelz/security-investigator.git
code security-investigator

# 2. Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate          # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure environment
copy config.json.template config.json
# Edit config.json → add your Sentinel workspace ID, tenant ID
copy .env.template .env
# Edit .env → add your API tokens (ipinfo, AbuseIPDB, vpnapi, Shodan)

# 4. Configure MCP servers
copy .vscode\mcp.json.template .vscode\mcp.json
# All platform servers are pre-configured — just needs a GitHub PAT on first use

# 5. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I) in Agent mode and ask:
#    "What skills do you have access to?"
#    "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days"
```

### How Skills Work

1. You ask Copilot a question (e.g., "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days")
2. Copilot detects keywords and loads the appropriate skill from `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. The skill provides specialized workflow, KQL queries, and risk assessment criteria
4. Universal patterns from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are inherited automatically

### Triggering Skills with Natural Language

You don't need to mention the skill name — keywords are detected automatically:

| What you say | Skill triggered |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days" | user-investigation |
| "Analyze incident 12345" | incident-investigation |
| "Is this IP malicious? 203.0.113.42" | ioc-investigation |
| "Check the device WORKSTATION-01 for threats" | computer-investigation |
| "Show attack patterns on a heatmap" | heatmap-visualization |
| "Generate an SVG dashboard from the report" | svg-dashboard |
| "Map the geographic origins of these attacks" | geomap-visualization |
| "Write a KQL query to find failed sign-ins" | kql-query-authoring |
| "Trace this authentication back to the original MFA" | authentication-tracing |
| "Detect scope drift in service principals" | scope-drift-detection/spn |
| "Check user behavioral drift for user@domain.com" | scope-drift-detection/user |
| "Analyze device process drift across the fleet" | scope-drift-detection/device |
| "Show me MCP server usage for the last 30 days" | mcp-usage-monitoring |
| "Generate a Sentinel ingestion report for the last 30 days" | sentinel-ingestion-report |
| "Create custom detections for Event ID 4799" | detection-authoring |
| "Deploy these detection rules to Defender XDR" | detection-authoring |
| "Audit AI agent security posture" | ai-agent-posture |
| "Show me unauthenticated Copilot Studio agents" | ai-agent-posture |
| "Who accessed files with credit card numbers?" | data-security-analysis |
| "Run a data security analysis for the last 30 days" | data-security-analysis |
| "Generate an email threat protection report" | email-threat-posture |
| "What's our phishing delivery rate for the last 30 days?" | email-threat-posture |

### Follow-ups and Chaining

After running an investigation, ask follow-up questions without re-running the entire workflow:

```
Is that IP a VPN?
Trace authentication for that suspicious location
Was MFA used for those sign-ins?
```

Skills can be chained for comprehensive analysis:

```
1. "Investigate incident 12345" → incident-investigation extracts entities
2. "Now investigate the user from that incident" → user-investigation runs on extracted UPN
3. "Check if that IP is malicious" → ioc-investigation analyzes the suspicious IP
4. "Show me a heatmap of the attack patterns" → heatmap-visualization
```

Copilot uses existing investigation data from `temp/investigation_*.json` when available.

### Discovering Skills

```

Explain the high-level workflow of the user-investigation skill
What data sources does the ioc-investigation skill use?
```

### Authoring New Skills from Investigations

One of the most powerful aspects of this project is that **ad-hoc threat hunting and investigations naturally evolve into reusable skills**. After completing an investigation — chasing a novel attack pattern, triaging an unfamiliar alert type, or building a new KQL query chain — you can ask Copilot to codify that workflow into a new SKILL.md file. This captures the verified queries, schema pitfalls, enrichment steps, and analytical logic so that any SOC analyst on the team can repeat the same high-quality investigation with a single natural-language prompt.

This extends beyond your own investigations. When new threat research drops — a blog post detailing an [AiTM phishing campaign](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/12/from-cookie-theft-to-bec-attackers-use-aitm-phishing-sites-as-entry-point-to-further-financial-fraud/), a write-up on a novel [scope drift detection technique](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftsentinelblog/the-agentic-soc-era-how-sentinel-mcp-enables-autonomous-security-reasoning/4491003), or an emerging ransomware TTP — you can feed the article URL to Copilot and ask it to extract the attacker behaviors, map them to relevant Sentinel tables, build the detection queries, validate them against your environment, and then package the entire workflow as a new skill. What used to be a manual process of reading a threat intel report, translating IOCs and TTPs into KQL, and documenting runbooks becomes a single conversational workflow.

It brings a DevOps mindset to Security Engineering: every investigation and every piece of external threat research becomes an opportunity to improve the shared knowledge base, drive collaboration across the team, and raise the overall quality bar — turning tribal knowledge into version-controlled, peer-reviewable, continuously improving automation.

**Sample prompts for creating a new skill:**

```
Based on the investigation we just completed, create a new reusable skill.
Review the queries we ran, the enrichment steps, and the analytical logic,
then package it all into a SKILL.md file following the existing skill format
in .github/skills/. Include the verified KQL queries, known schema pitfalls,
and a step-by-step workflow that another analyst could follow.
```

```

Extract the attacker TTPs — initial access, persistence mechanisms, lateral
movement, and exfiltration techniques. Map each TTP to the relevant Sentinel
and Defender tables, write detection queries, and create a new investigation
skill that hunts for these behaviors across our environment.

### Query Library (`queries/`)

The `queries/` folder contains **verified, battle-tested KQL query collections** organized by detection scenario. These are the **Priority 2 lookup source** in the [KQL Pre-Flight Checklist](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — Copilot searches them before writing any ad-hoc KQL.

Each file uses a standardized metadata header for efficient `grep_search` discovery:
```markdown
# <Title>
**Tables:** <exact KQL table names>
**Keywords:** <searchable terms — attack techniques, scenarios, field names>
**MITRE:** <ATT&CK technique IDs, e.g., T1021.001, TA0008>
```

The **Graph MCP server** requires a [one-time tenant provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/mcp-server/get-started?tabs=http%2Cvscode) by an admin. See [MCP Server Setup](#-mcp-server-setup) for detailed per-server requirements. |
| **Microsoft.Graph PowerShell** | Required for `detection-authoring` skill (`CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All` — create/update/delete custom detection rules via Graph API). Also used by `sentinel-ingestion-report` skill for rule inventory (`CustomDetection.Read.All` — read-only, degrades gracefully if not installed). `Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser`. |
| **GitHub PAT** | `public_repo` scope — [Create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Used by KQL Search MCP. |

### 1. Install Dependencies

Verify prerequisites:
```powershell
python --version   # Requires 3.8+
node --version     # Requires 18+ (needed for KQL Search MCP)
az --version       # Azure CLI (needed for Azure MCP Server, ingestion report skill)
pwsh --version     # Requires 7.0+ (needed for sentinel-ingestion-report skill)
```

If Node.js is missing: [Download](https://nodejs.org/) or run `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (Windows) / `brew install node` (macOS).
If Azure CLI is missing: [Install](https://aka.ms/installazurecli), then `az login --tenant <tenant_id>` and `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`.
If the `log-analytics` extension is missing: `az extension add --name log-analytics` (required for `sentinel-ingestion-report` skill).

Set up Python environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json` and fill in your workspace details:

```json
{
  "sentinel_workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE",
  "tenant_id": "YOUR_TENANT_ID_HERE",
  "subscription_id": "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_HERE",
  "azure_mcp": {
    "resource_group": "YOUR_LOG_ANALYTICS_RESOURCE_GROUP",
    "workspace_name": "YOUR_LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_NAME",
    "tenant": "YOUR_TENANT_ID_HERE",
    "subscription": "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_HERE"
  },
  "output_dir": "reports"
}
```

| Setting | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `sentinel_workspace_id` | Yes | Microsoft Sentinel (Log Analytics) workspace GUID |
| `tenant_id` | Yes | Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant ID for your Sentinel workspace |
| `subscription_id` | Yes | Azure subscription ID containing the Sentinel workspace |
| `azure_mcp.*` | Yes | Azure MCP Server parameters — resource group, workspace name, tenant, subscription. Required to avoid cross-tenant auth errors. |
| `output_dir` | No | Directory for HTML reports (default: `reports`) |

#### API Tokens (`.env` file)

API tokens for IP enrichment are stored in a `.env` file (gitignored) rather than `config.json` for security. Copy the template and add your keys:

```powershell
copy .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your token values
```

```dotenv
IPINFO_TOKEN=your_token_here
ABUSEIPDB_TOKEN=your_token_here
VPNAPI_TOKEN=your_token_here
SHODAN_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

These are auto-loaded by `enrich_ips.py` via `python-dotenv` — no manual sourcing needed.

| Token | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `IPINFO_TOKEN` | Recommended | [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) API token — geolocation, ASN, org. Free: 1K/day; token: 50K/month; paid plans include VPN detection |
| `ABUSEIPDB_TOKEN` | Recommended | [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) API token — IP reputation scoring (0-100 confidence). Free: 1K/day |
| `VPNAPI_TOKEN` | Optional | [vpnapi.io](https://vpnapi.io/) API token — VPN/proxy/Tor detection. Not needed if ipinfo.io is on a paid plan |
| `SHODAN_TOKEN` | Optional | [Shodan](https://account.shodan.io/) API key — open ports, services, CVEs, OS detection, tags. Free InternetDB fallback if no key or credits exhausted |

### 3. Configure MCP Servers

Copy the MCP server template (all platform servers + 3 optional MCP Apps are pre-configured):

```powershell
copy .vscode/mcp.json.template .vscode/mcp.json
```

The template includes inline documentation for each server. On first use, VS Code will prompt for:
- **Entra ID login** — browser-based auth for Sentinel Data Lake, Graph, Triage, and Sentinel Graph servers
- **[GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)** — for KQL Search MCP (schema intelligence and query discovery). Needs `public_repo` scope.

See [MCP Server Setup](#-mcp-server-setup) below for per-server permissions and installation guides.

### 4. Build MCP Apps (Optional — Visualization Skills)

> ⚠️ **VS Code Insiders Required:** MCP Apps currently require [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). Requires **Node.js 18+**.

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-geomap-server; npm install; npm run build; cd ../..
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-heatmap-server; npm install; npm run build; cd ../..
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment; npm install; npm run build; cd ../..
```

**Bash (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-geomap-server && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-heatmap-server && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
```

The `sentinel-incident-comment` MCP App requires an Azure Logic App backend. See [mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment/README.md](mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment/README.md) for setup. Based on [stefanpems/mcp-add-comment-to-sentinel-incident](https://github.com/stefanpems/mcp-add-comment-to-sentinel-incident).

### 1. Microsoft Sentinel MCP Server

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/developer/mcp-get-started)**

**Tools:** `query_lake`, `search_tables`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`

**Permissions:**
- **Log Analytics Reader** (minimum) — query workspace data
- **Sentinel Reader** (recommended) — full investigation capabilities
- **Sentinel Contributor** — watchlist management (optional)

### 2. MCP Server for Microsoft Graph

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/mcp-server/get-started?tabs=http%2Cvscode)**

**Tools:** `microsoft_graph_suggest_queries`, `microsoft_graph_get`, `microsoft_graph_list_properties`

**⚡ One-time tenant provisioning** (requires **Application Administrator** or **Cloud Application Administrator** role):

```powershell
# 1. Install the Entra Beta PowerShell module (v1.0.13+)
Install-Module Microsoft.Entra.Beta -Force -AllowClobber

# 2. Authenticate to your tenant

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### API Rate Limits (IP Enrichment)

| Provider | Free Tier | With Token |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **ipinfo.io** | 1,000/day (geo, org, ASN) | 50,000/month; paid plans include VPN detection |
| **AbuseIPDB** | 1,000/day | 10,000/day ($20/month) |
| **vpnapi.io** | 1,000/month | 10,000/month ($9.99/month) |
| **Shodan** | InternetDB (unlimited, ports/vulns/tags) | $49 one-time membership: 100 queries/month (adds services, banners, SSL, OS) |

**Token priority:** If `ipinfo_token` is a paid plan, VPN detection is included and `vpnapi_token` is optional. Shodan uses the full API when a paid key is available; on 403/429 it automatically falls back to the free InternetDB.

IP enrichment happens during **report generation** (not data collection), so you can re-generate reports without re-querying Sentinel/Graph.

### Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Core packages: **requests** (HTTP client for enrichment APIs), **python-dateutil** (date parsing for KQL time ranges).

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Confidential Data** — Reports contain PII and sensitive security data. Mark as CONFIDENTIAL and follow organizational data classification policies.
2. **Access Control** — Restrict access to authorized SOC personnel. Use Azure RBAC for Sentinel, PIM for Graph API permissions.
3. **Audit Trail** — All investigations are timestamped. JSON files in `temp/` preserve snapshots; HTML reports include generation metadata.
4. **Data Retention** — Investigations older than 3 days are auto-deleted (configurable). Archive important investigations before cleanup.
5. **API Token Security** — Never commit `config.json` with tokens (already in `.gitignore`). Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production.
6. **Investigation JSON Files** — Stored in `temp/` (not committed to Git). Contain complete data including IP enrichment. Can be re-analyzed without re-querying.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No anomalies found"** | `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL` table doesn't exist or has no data. See user-investigation skill docs. Wait 24h for initial population. |
| **"IP enrichment failed"** | ipinfo.io rate limits (1K/day free). Add token to `config.json` for 50K/month. |
| **"MCP server not available"** | Check VS Code MCP server config. Verify authentication tokens are valid. |
| **"User ID not found" (Graph)** | Verify UPN is correct. Check Graph permissions: User.Read.All. |
| **"Sentinel query timeout"** | Reduce date range. Add `\| take 10` to limit results. |
| **Report generation fails** | Validate JSON: `python -m json.tool temp/investigation_*.json`. Check required fields. |
| **SecurityIncident returns 0 results** | Use BOTH `targetUPN` and `targetUserId` (Object ID). Some incidents use Object ID. |
| **Risky sign-ins 404** | Must use `/beta` endpoint, not `/v1.0`. |

### Verify Connectivity

In **Copilot Chat** (Agent mode):
- `"List my Sentinel workspaces"` — verifies Sentinel Data Lake MCP
- `"Look up user@domain.com in Graph"` — verifies Graph MCP
- `"List recent incidents"` — verifies Sentinel Triage MCP

In **terminal**:
```powershell
python enrich_ips.py 8.8.8.8    # Verifies IP enrichment API tokens
```
