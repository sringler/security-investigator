## Overview

Combines Microsoft Security Exposure Management (ExposureGraph) topology with MDE network telemetry to identify and validate internet-facing assets. The ExposureGraph provides the **theoretical** attack surface (what firewall rules allow), while DeviceNetworkEvents provides the **observed** attack surface (what connections are actually happening).

### Data Source Summary

| Table | Source | What It Tells You |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| `ExposureGraphNodes` | Exposure Management | Which devices/IPs are flagged as customer-facing, exposure scores, public IPs |
| `ExposureGraphEdges` | Exposure Management | Firewall/NSG rules: what ports are allowed from what CIDRs |
| `DeviceNetworkEvents` | MDE | Actual inbound connections accepted, connection failures (probes), listening ports |
| `DeviceNetworkInfo` | MDE | Network adapter config: public IPs, `IsConnectedToInternet` flag, network categories |

### Key ActionTypes in DeviceNetworkEvents

| ActionType | Meaning | Use For |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `InboundConnectionAccepted` | Remote IP successfully connected inbound | Confirming exposure — something is listening AND reachable |
| `ConnectionFailed` | Connection attempt failed (RST/timeout) | Detecting scanning/probing against closed ports |
| `ConnectionAttempt` | Outbound or inbound TCP attempt | Port probing (when LocalPort is populated with RemoteIPType=Public) |
| `ListeningConnectionCreated` | Process opened a listening socket | Service discovery — what ports are open on each device |

## Query 1: Customer-Facing Devices (Exposure Graph)

Devices flagged as internet-facing by Exposure Management, with exposure scores and public IPs.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Posture inventory query — ExposureGraphNodes summarize/project, not suitable for row-level alerting"
-->

```kql
// Customer-facing devices with exposure scores
ExposureGraphNodes
| where NodeLabel == "device"
| extend Props = parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties.rawData))
| extend isCustomerFacing = tobool(Props.isCustomerFacing)
| extend publicIP = tostring(Props.publicIP)
| extend deviceName = tostring(Props.deviceName)
| extend osPlatform = tostring(Props.osPlatformFriendlyName)
| extend exposureScore = tostring(Props.exposureScore)
| extend deviceType = tostring(Props.deviceType)
| extend onboardingStatus = tostring(Props.onboardingStatus)
| extend riskScore = tostring(Props.riskScore)
| where isCustomerFacing == true
| project deviceName, publicIP, osPlatform, deviceType, exposureScore, riskScore, onboardingStatus
| order by exposureScore desc
```

**Key fields:**
- `isCustomerFacing`: Boolean — Exposure Management's determination of internet reachability
- `exposureScore`: None / Low / Medium / High — composite vulnerability + configuration score
- `publicIP`: The public IP assigned to the device (may be empty for NAT'd devices)

---

## Query 2: Internet-Exposed Firewall Rules (Exposure Graph)

Extracts all firewall/NSG rules that allow traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` (the entire internet) to specific resources, with port and protocol details.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Posture inventory query — ExposureGraphEdges topology, not event-driven. Use for scheduled posture snapshots, not CD alerts"
-->

```kql
// Firewall rules allowing traffic from the internet
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel == "routes traffic to"
| extend edgeProps = parse_json(tostring(EdgeProperties.rawData))
| extend trafficRaw = tostring(edgeProps.allowedAffectiveTraffic)
| where isnotempty(trafficRaw) and trafficRaw has "0.0.0.0/0"
| extend srcIP = tostring(SourceNodeName)
| extend tgtResource = tostring(TargetNodeName)
| extend tgtType = TargetNodeLabel
| project srcIP, tgtResource, tgtType, trafficRaw
```

**To parse individual port rules from the nested JSON:**

```kql
// Parsed firewall rules — one row per allowed port range
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel == "routes traffic to"
| extend edgeProps = parse_json(tostring(EdgeProperties.rawData))
| extend trafficStr = tostring(edgeProps.allowedAffectiveTraffic)
| where isnotempty(trafficStr) and trafficStr has "0.0.0.0/0"
| extend srcIP = tostring(SourceNodeName)
| extend tgtResource = tostring(TargetNodeName)
| extend tgtType = TargetNodeLabel
| project srcIP, tgtResource, tgtType, trafficStr
| extend trafficJson = parse_json(trafficStr)
| mv-expand rule = trafficJson
| extend destPorts = tostring(rule.destinationPortRanges)
| extend srcCIDR = tostring(rule.sourceCidr)
| extend protocol = case(
    tostring(rule.protocolRanges) == '["6"]', "TCP",
    tostring(rule.protocolRanges) == '["17"]', "UDP",
    tostring(rule.protocolRanges) == '["1"]', "ICMP",
    tostring(rule.protocolRanges))
| where srcCIDR has "0.0.0.0/0"
| project srcIP, tgtResource, tgtType, destPorts, protocol, srcCIDR
| order by tgtResource asc
```

**Risky port filter — find resources with RDP/SSH/SMB open from internet:**

```kql
// High-risk ports exposed to the internet
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel == "routes traffic to"
| extend edgeProps = parse_json(tostring(EdgeProperties.rawData))
| extend trafficStr = tostring(edgeProps.allowedAffectiveTraffic)
| where isnotempty(trafficStr) and trafficStr has "0.0.0.0/0"
| where trafficStr has_any ("3389", "22", "445", "1433", "3306", "5432", "27017", "6379")
| extend srcIP = tostring(SourceNodeName)
| extend tgtResource = tostring(TargetNodeName)
| extend tgtType = TargetNodeLabel
| project srcIP, tgtResource, tgtType, trafficStr
```

## Query 3: Inbound Connections Accepted — Device Ranking

Confirms exposure by showing which devices are actually receiving inbound connections from public IPs, ranked by volume and source IP diversity.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "24H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "Internet-exposed device {{DeviceName}} accepted {{InboundConnections}} inbound connections"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device
    identifier: deviceName
recommendedActions: "Review NSG/firewall rules for this device. Verify that inbound services are intentionally exposed. Check if the device should be customer-facing."
adaptation_notes: "Remove summarize — convert to row-level with per-connection rows. Add DeviceId, RemoteIP, LocalPort columns. Consider threshold filter (e.g., > 50 connections/day) to avoid noise"
-->

```kql
// Devices receiving inbound connections from the internet
let lookback = 7d;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAccepted"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| summarize 
    InboundConnections = count(),
    UniqueSourceIPs = dcount(RemoteIP),
    TargetPorts = make_set(LocalPort, 20),
    DistinctPorts = dcount(LocalPort),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp)
    by DeviceName
| order by InboundConnections desc
```

## Query 4: Inbound Connections by Port

Shows which ports are receiving the most inbound traffic from the internet — identifies the highest-risk services.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Statistical summary grouped by port — useful for posture reporting but not row-level alerting. Use Query 3 or 11 for CD-ready variants"
-->

```kql
// Inbound accepted connections by destination port
let lookback = 7d;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAccepted"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| summarize 
    Connections = count(),
    UniqueSourceIPs = dcount(RemoteIP),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 10),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName)
    by LocalPort
| extend Service = case(
    LocalPort == 22, "SSH",

    LocalPort == 18789, "OpenClaw-GW",
    strcat("Port-", tostring(LocalPort)))
| order by Connections desc
```

## Query 5: Top Inbound Attackers by Source IP

Identifies the most active source IPs sending inbound connections — useful for enrichment and threat intel correlation.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "High-volume inbound attacker {{RemoteIP}} targeting {{DeviceCount}} devices"
impactedAssets:

recommendedActions: "Enrich the source IP via enrich_ips.py or TI lookup. If abuse score is high, consider blocking at NSG/firewall level. Check if connections were to risky ports (RDP, SSH, SMB)."
adaptation_notes: "Restructure to row-level: remove summarize, project per-connection rows with RemoteIP, DeviceName, LocalPort. Add threshold (e.g., dcount(DeviceName) > 3) to detect multi-device scanners"
-->

```kql
// Top source IPs making inbound connections
let lookback = 7d;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAccepted"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| summarize 
    Connections = count(),
    TargetDevices = make_set(DeviceName, 10),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName),
    TargetPorts = make_set(LocalPort, 10),
    PortCount = dcount(LocalPort),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp)
    by RemoteIP
| order by Connections desc
| take 25
```

## Query 6: RDP Brute-Force Analysis

Deep-dive into RDP (3389) exposure — hourly attack cadence, top attackers, and target device distribution.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "RDP brute-force activity on {{DeviceName}} from {{RemoteIP}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device

recommendedActions: "Verify RDP should be internet-exposed. Consider restricting to JIT access or VPN-only. Enrich attacker IP. Check for successful RDP logons following brute-force attempts."
adaptation_notes: "First KQL block (hourly cadence) is statistical — not CD-ready. Second block (top attackers) needs row-level conversion: remove summarize, project per-connection rows. Add DeviceId, ReportId"
-->

```kql
// RDP inbound — hourly attack cadence
let lookback = 7d;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAccepted"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| where LocalPort == 3389
| summarize Connections = count() by bin(Timestamp, 1h), DeviceName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

```kql

let lookback = 7d;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAccepted"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| where LocalPort == 3389
| summarize 
    Hits = count(),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 10),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName)
    by RemoteIP
| order by Hits desc
| take 20
```

## Query 7: Connection Failures — Scanning/Probing Detection

Detects failed inbound connections — indicates port scanning or probing against closed/filtered ports.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "3H"
category: "Discovery"
title: "Port scanning detected — {{Failures}} failed connections on port {{LocalPort}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device
    identifier: deviceName
recommendedActions: "Review which ports are being probed. If high-value ports (RDP, SSH, SMB), verify firewall rules are blocking. Enrich top source IPs for threat intel."
adaptation_notes: "Summarize by LocalPort — needs restructure to row-level per-device. Add DeviceName to group-by or convert to per-connection rows. Add threshold filter to avoid ephemeral port noise"

DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| summarize 
    Failures = count(),
    UniqueSourceIPs = dcount(RemoteIP),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 10),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName)
    by LocalPort

    strcat("Ephemeral-", tostring(LocalPort)))
| order by Failures desc
```

## Query 8: Listening Ports — Service Discovery

Shows what ports each device has opened for listening in the last 7 days. Focus on well-known ports (< 10000) to identify actual services vs ephemeral.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "24H"
category: "Discovery"
title: "New listening port {{LocalPort}} opened on {{DeviceName}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device
    identifier: deviceName
recommendedActions: "Verify the listening process is authorized. Check if the port is exposed to the internet via NSG/firewall. Investigate the InitiatingProcess for unexpected services."
adaptation_notes: "Remove summarize — convert to per-event rows with DeviceName, LocalPort, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine. Add DeviceId, ReportId. Filter to risky ports only for CD (22, 80, 443, 445, 3389, 8080, 18789)"
-->

```kql
// Well-known listening ports per device
let lookback = 7d;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(lookback)
| where ActionType == "ListeningConnectionCreated"
| where LocalPort > 0 and LocalPort < 10000
| summarize 
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 15),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName),
    Occurrences = count()
    by LocalPort
| extend Service = case(
    LocalPort == 22, "SSH",
    LocalPort == 80, "HTTP",
    LocalPort == 139, "NetBIOS",
    LocalPort == 443, "HTTPS",

    LocalPort == 7680, "WUDO (Delivery Opt)",
    LocalPort == 7768, "BeyondTrust/Other",
    LocalPort == 8080, "HTTP-Alt",
    LocalPort == 18789, "OpenClaw-GW",
    strcat("Port-", tostring(LocalPort)))
| order by DeviceCount desc, LocalPort asc
```

## Query 9: DeviceNetworkInfo — Devices on Public Networks

Lists MDE-enrolled devices that report being connected to the internet, with their public IP assignments and network category.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "DeviceNetworkInfo snapshot query — reports current state, not security events. Not suitable for CD alerting. Use for posture enrichment in other queries"
-->

```kql
// Devices with IsConnectedToInternet = true and public network category
DeviceNetworkInfo
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId
| mv-expand Net = parse_json(ConnectedNetworks)
| extend IsInternet = tobool(Net.IsConnectedToInternet)
| extend NetCategory = tostring(Net.Category)
| where IsInternet == true and NetCategory == "Public"
| mv-expand IPset = parse_json(IPAddresses)
| extend IPAddr = tostring(IPset.IPAddress)
| extend IPType = tostring(IPset.AddressType)
| project DeviceName, IPAddr, IPType, NetCategory, Timestamp
| order by DeviceName asc
```

## Query 10: Exposure Validation — Cross-Reference Graph Rules with Observed Traffic

Joins ExposureGraph firewall rules (what's allowed) with DeviceNetworkEvents (what's observed) to find gaps — rules that allow traffic but no observed connections (unused exposure), or connections on ports not in the rule set (unexpected exposure).

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Cross-table join with let statements and leftouter join — multi-table correlation query not suitable for CD. Uses ExposureGraphNodes (static topology) + DeviceNetworkEvents. Use for scheduled posture reporting"
-->

```kql
// Step 1: Get customer-facing devices from ExposureGraph
let ExposedDevices = ExposureGraphNodes
| where NodeLabel == "device"
| extend Props = parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties.rawData))
| where tobool(Props.isCustomerFacing) == true
| extend deviceName = tolower(tostring(Props.deviceName))
| extend publicIP = tostring(Props.publicIP)
| extend exposureScore = tostring(Props.exposureScore)
| project deviceName, publicIP, exposureScore;
// Step 2: Get observed inbound connections
let ObservedInbound = DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAccepted"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| summarize 
    InboundCount = count(),
    UniqueIPs = dcount(RemoteIP),
    Ports = make_set(LocalPort, 20)
    by DeviceName
| extend deviceName = tolower(DeviceName);
// Step 3: Cross-reference — what's exposed vs what's seeing traffic
ExposedDevices
| join kind=leftouter ObservedInbound on deviceName
| extend HasObservedTraffic = isnotnull(InboundCount)
| project deviceName, publicIP, exposureScore, 
    HasObservedTraffic, InboundCount, UniqueIPs, Ports
| order by InboundCount desc
```

**Interpretation:**
- `HasObservedTraffic = true` + high InboundCount → **Confirmed exposure, actively targeted**
- `HasObservedTraffic = false` + customer-facing → **Theoretically exposed but not yet targeted** (or MDE agent not reporting)
- Not in ExposureGraph but receiving inbound → **Shadow exposure** (missing from topology model)

## Query 11: Specific Port Exposure Hunt

Template query for hunting inbound connections on a specific port — replace `<TARGET_PORT>` with the port of interest (e.g., 18789 for OpenClaw gateway).

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "Inbound connection activity on monitored port {{LocalPort}} on {{DeviceName}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device

    Attempts = countif(ActionType == "ConnectionAttempt"),
    Failed = countif(ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"),
    UniqueIPs = dcount(RemoteIP),
    TopIPs = make_set(RemoteIP, 20),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp)
    by DeviceName
| extend Status = case(
    Accepted > 0, "🔴 ACCEPTING CONNECTIONS",
    Attempts > 10, "🟠 Being Probed (likely closed)",
    Attempts > 0, "🟡 Minor probing",
    Failed > 0, "🔵 Connection failures only",
    "✅ No activity")
| order by Accepted desc, Attempts desc
```

## Query 12: ExposureGraph Node Type Inventory

Discovery query — enumerate all node types and counts in the ExposureGraph to understand your topology coverage.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Pure inventory/discovery query — summarize count() by NodeLabel/EdgeLabel. No security event to alert on"
-->

```kql
// ExposureGraph node type inventory
ExposureGraphNodes
| summarize Count = count() by NodeLabel
| order by Count desc
```

```kql
// ExposureGraph edge type inventory
ExposureGraphEdges
| summarize Count = count() by EdgeLabel
| order by Count desc
```

---

## Query 13: IP Address Nodes — Public IP Inventory

Lists all public IP address nodes in the ExposureGraph with their associated categories and properties.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "ExposureGraph topology inventory — static IP listing with route-to edges. Not event-driven, not suitable for CD"
-->

```kql
// All IP address nodes in ExposureGraph
ExposureGraphNodes

| extend Props = parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties.rawData))
| extend ipAddress = tostring(Props.ipAddress)
| extend fqdn = tostring(Props.fqdn)
| project NodeName, ipAddress, fqdn, Categories = tostring(NodeCategories)
| order by ipAddress asc
```

**Follow-up: what resources does each IP route traffic to?**

```kql
// IP → resource routing with traffic rules
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel == "routes traffic to"
| where SourceNodeLabel == "IP address"
| extend edgeProps = parse_json(tostring(EdgeProperties.rawData))
| extend traffic = tostring(edgeProps.allowedAffectiveTraffic)
| project 
    SourceIP = SourceNodeName, 
    TargetResource = TargetNodeName, 
    TargetType = TargetNodeLabel,
    TrafficRules = traffic
| order by SourceIP asc
```

## Investigation Workflow

### Full Internet Exposure Assessment

1. **Run Query 1** — Identify all customer-facing devices
2. **Run Query 2** — Check what firewall rules allow from `0.0.0.0/0`
3. **Run Query 3+4** — Confirm which devices/ports are actually receiving inbound traffic
4. **Run Query 10** — Cross-reference: exposed devices with vs without observed traffic
5. **Run Query 7** — Check what scanning/probing is hitting closed ports
6. **Run Query 8** — Inventory all listening ports across the fleet
7. **Enrich top attacker IPs** using `enrich_ips.py` from Query 5 output

### Specific Port Hunt (e.g., OpenClaw 18789)

1. **Run Query 11** with `targetPort = 18789`
2. **Run Query 2** (risky port variant) — check if NSG/firewall allows 18789
3. **Enrich source IPs** from Query 11 output
4. Cross-reference with process-level evidence (DeviceProcessEvents for the listening service)

### Key Telemetry Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Workaround |
|-----|--------|------------|
| ExposureGraph only covers resources with Azure/GCP/AWS connectors | On-prem or unmanaged devices won't appear in topology queries | Use DeviceNetworkEvents `InboundConnectionAccepted` to detect exposure empirically |
| `ConnectionAttempt` may not always populate for inbound probes | Missing some scanning evidence | Use `ConnectionFailed` as primary probe detection |
| DeviceNetworkInfo `IsConnectedToInternet` is self-reported by the OS | NAT'd devices behind corporate firewalls may report true | Cross-reference with ExposureGraph `isCustomerFacing` for accurate internet reachability |
| ExposureGraph has 30-day retention in Advanced Hunting | Can't look back further for historical topology changes | Snapshot key queries periodically for trend analysis |
