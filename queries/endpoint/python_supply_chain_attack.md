## Overview

This hunting campaign targets TTPs from the **LiteLLM PyPI supply chain compromise** disclosed March 24, 2026:  
**[Security Update: Suspected Supply Chain Incident](https://docs.litellm.ai/blog/security-update-march-2026)**

Related upstream compromise: **[Trivy Supply Chain Attack](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/trivy-supply-chain-attack-what-you-need-to-know/)**

### Threat Summary

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Affected Packages** | `litellm==1.82.7`, `litellm==1.82.8` (removed from PyPI) |
| **Compromise Window** | March 24, 2026, 10:39–16:00 UTC (46 minutes before PyPI quarantine) |
| **Downloads During Window** | 46,996 (32,464 for v1.82.8, 14,532 for v1.82.7) |
| **Dependent Packages** | 2,337 on PyPI — 88% had version specs allowing compromised versions |
| **Attack Vector** | Compromised maintainer PyPI account (via Checkmarx/Trivy CI/CD compromise) |
| **v1.82.8 Payload** | `litellm_init.pth` — .pth startup hook, runs on ANY Python interpreter start including `pip install` itself. Fork bomb bug made it visible |
| **v1.82.7 Payload** | Injected in `proxy_server.py`, drops `p.py` — triggers only when `litellm.proxy` is imported (proxy servers, not SDK) |
| **C2 Domain (v1.82.8)** | `models.litellm[.]cloud` (NOT a legitimate BerriAI domain) |
| **C2 Domain (v1.82.7)** | `checkmarx[.]zone/raw` (typosquat of legitimate Checkmarx security vendor) |
| **Exfil Method** | AES-256-CBC encryption (random session key) + RSA-4096 public key wrapping → tar archive → POST to C2 |
| **Persistence** | `~/.config/sysmon/sysmon.py` + `~/.config/systemd/user/sysmon.service` |
| **K8s Lateral Movement** | Reads ALL cluster secrets, deploys privileged `alpine:latest` pods (`node-setup-*`) on every node in `kube-system` with host filesystem mount |
| **Credential Targets** | Env vars, SSH keys, AWS/GCP/Azure creds, K8s tokens/configs, DB passwords, git creds, Docker configs, npm/vault tokens, shell history, crypto wallets, SSL private keys, CI/CD files, IMDS metadata |
| **MCP Attack Surface** | Cursor/Claude Code MCP servers with unpinned litellm transitive deps pulled malicious version via `uvx` auto-download |

recommendedActions: "Verify litellm version installed. If v1.82.7 or v1.82.8, treat as confirmed compromise. Isolate device, rotate all secrets, check for litellm_init.pth in site-packages."
adaptation_notes: "Already row-level. Add DeviceId + ReportId columns."
-->

```kql
// Detect pip install litellm commands — direct or as dependency
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where ProcessCommandLine has "litellm"
    and (ProcessCommandLine has "pip install"

### Query 2 — Broad pip/pip3 Install Activity Audit (DeviceProcessEvents)

**Goal:** Enumerate ALL pip install commands for supply chain exposure review. Useful to understand which devices run pip and what packages are being installed.  
**MITRE:** T1195.002

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Audit/inventory query using summarize with make_set and dcount — not suitable for CD alerting."

### Query 4 — Malicious .pth File Detection (DeviceFileEvents)

**Goal:** Broader hunt for ANY suspicious `.pth` files in Python site-packages. The `.pth` file mechanism runs arbitrary Python at interpreter startup (T1547.004) and is increasingly abused in supply chain attacks.  
**MITRE:** T1547.004

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "24H"

recommendedActions: "Inspect .pth file contents — .pth files execute arbitrary Python at interpreter startup. Verify the file is legitimate (expected package) or malicious (supply chain persistence)."
adaptation_notes: "Already row-level with allowlist exclusions. Add DeviceId + ReportId. 24H schedule suitable — .pth persistence is not time-critical."
-->

```kql
// Hunt for suspicious .pth files in Python site-packages
// .pth files execute Python code at interpreter startup — supply chain persistence mechanism
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)

### Query 6 — C2 Domain DNS Resolution (ASIM DNS)

**Goal:** Detect DNS lookups for the litellm C2 domain `models.litellm[.]cloud` using ASIM-normalized DNS logs. This catches resolution attempts even if the HTTP connection was blocked.  
**MITRE:** T1041, T1071.001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "CommandAndControl"
title: "DNS resolution of litellm C2 domain detected from {{SrcIpAddr}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device
    identifier: deviceName
recommendedActions: "DNS lookup for litellm C2 domain detected — even if the HTTP connection was blocked, a compromised package attempted to resolve the C2. Identify the source device via SrcIpAddr, check for litellm installation, rotate secrets."
adaptation_notes: "Sentinel/LA table — use TimeGenerated. Dvc may serve as DeviceName proxy. No native ReportId — use EventUid as proxy. Verify Dvc populates as hostname."
-->

```kql
// Hunt for DNS resolution of litellm C2 domain via ASIM DNS logs
ASimDnsActivityLogs

    EventResult,
    Dvc,
    EventProduct
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

---

### Query 7 — PyPI Download Activity on Compromise Date (ASIM DNS)

**Goal:** Identify any devices that resolved PyPI domains during the compromise window (March 24, 2026 10:39–16:00 UTC). These devices may have pulled the malicious package.  
**MITRE:** T1195.002

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "One-time forensic query for a fixed time window (March 24 compromise). Not suitable for ongoing CD — hardcoded datetime range."
-->

```kql
// Identify devices resolving PyPI during the compromise window

    EventResult,
    Dvc
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

---

### Query 8 — PyPI Download Activity Baseline (ASIM DNS)

**Goal:** Broader 30-day view of PyPI-related DNS lookups to understand which devices regularly pull Python packages. Useful for scoping supply chain exposure.  
**MITRE:** T1195.002

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Baseline/inventory query using summarize — designed for exposure scoping, not alerting."
-->

    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated),
    DnsQueries = make_set(DnsQuery, 10)
    by SrcIpAddr, Dvc
| order by QueryCount desc
```

---

### Query 9 — Python Process Spawning Suspicious Network Connections (DeviceNetworkEvents)

**Goal:** Detect Python processes making outbound connections to unusual domains — catches both litellm-specific and generic Python-based exfiltration.  
**MITRE:** T1041, T1071.001, T1059.006

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Summarize aggregation by RemoteUrl/RemoteIP — designed for threat hunting review, not CD. High false-positive rate without tuning to specific environment."

### Query 10 — Environment Variable Access by Python (DeviceProcessEvents)

**Goal:** Detect Python processes that enumerate environment variables — a key TTP of the litellm stealer payload. Looks for `os.environ`, `printenv`, `env`, and `set` commands spawned by Python.  
**MITRE:** T1082, T1552.001

<!-- cd-metadata

    identifier: accountName
recommendedActions: "Python spawned a child process that enumerates environment variables. This is a key TTP of credential-stealing packages (litellm, ultralytics, etc.). Investigate the parent Python script and check for recent pip installs."
adaptation_notes: "Already row-level. Add DeviceId + ReportId. May need FP tuning for legitimate dev workflows."
-->

```kql
// Python spawning environment enumeration commands (credential harvesting indicator)

### Query 11 — SSH Key and Cloud Credential File Access (DeviceFileEvents)

**Goal:** Detect Python processes reading SSH keys and cloud provider credential files — the litellm stealer specifically targets these.  
**MITRE:** T1552.001, T1005

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true

### Query 12 — Python Package Installation via CI/CD Agents (DeviceProcessEvents)

**Goal:** Detect pip install activity from CI/CD runners or automation accounts. These are high-risk because they often have unpinned dependencies and broad secret access.  
**MITRE:** T1195.002

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true

### Query 13 — Unpinned pip install Detection (DeviceProcessEvents)

**Goal:** Find pip install commands that DON'T pin a version — these would have pulled the latest (compromised) version during the window. `pip install litellm` without `==1.82.6` or similar is the exact attack vector.  
**MITRE:** T1195.002

<!-- cd-metadata

### Query 14 — Post-Compromise Secret Exfiltration Pattern (DeviceNetworkEvents)

**Goal:** Detect the specific exfiltration pattern: Python process making an outbound POST with encrypted data. The litellm stealer encrypts harvested secrets and POSTs them to the C2.  
**MITRE:** T1041, T1027

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Cross-table join with let variable and time-window correlation (PipTime + 1h). Not suitable for NRT. Could be adapted for 1H schedule but join complexity and potential FP volume makes it better as a hunting query."

## Triage Playbook

If any of the above queries return positive results:

### Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)

1. **Isolate affected device** via MDE device isolation
2. **Identify installed version**: On affected system run `pip show litellm` — if version is 1.82.7 or 1.82.8, treat as confirmed compromise
3. **Check for .pth file**: Search for `litellm_init.pth` in Python site-packages directories
4. **Check for persistence**: Look for `~/.config/sysmon/sysmon.py` and `~/.config/systemd/user/sysmon.service`
5. **Rotate ALL secrets** accessible from that device: API keys, SSH keys, cloud credentials, K8s tokens, DB passwords, environment variables, git creds, Docker registry tokens

### Investigation Steps

1. **Scope impact**: Run Query 2 to find all pip activity on the affected device
2. **Check C2 traffic**: Run Queries 5 + 6 (v1.82.8 C2) AND Queries 19 + 20 (v1.82.7 C2) to confirm exfiltration attempts
3. **Persistence check**: Run Queries 21 + 22 to detect installed backdoors
4. **Fork bomb evidence**: Run Query 24 — if Python process counts spiked, device was affected by the .pth bug
5. **Credential file access**: Run Queries 11 + 26 + 29 to check what secrets were accessed
6. **K8s lateral movement**: If K8s environment, run Query 23 for secret enumeration and privileged pod deployment
7. **Cloud credential theft**: Run Query 27 for IMDS metadata access
8. **Timeline correlation**: Run Query 14 to trace pip install → network activity chain
9. **Lateral movement risk**: Check if stolen credentials were used elsewhere (pivot to user-investigation or authentication-tracing skills)

### Evidence Preservation

- Export `DeviceProcessEvents` for affected device/timeframe
- Capture DNS logs around the compromise window
- Preserve network connection logs showing C2 communication to BOTH `models.litellm[.]cloud` and `checkmarx[.]zone`
- Check for persistence artifacts: `~/.config/sysmon/` directory, systemd user services
- If K8s: enumerate `node-setup-*` pods in `kube-system` namespace
- Document all rotated credentials and rotation timestamps

## Mitigations & Guidance

### 1. MCP Architecture: Vendor-Hosted vs Self-Built

The litellm attack directly illustrates the risk of self-hosted MCP servers with transitive Python dependencies. Cursor and Claude Code users running MCP servers via `uvx` with unpinned litellm deps auto-downloaded the compromised version — the MCP server itself became the attack vector.

| Risk | Self-Built MCP | Vendor-Hosted MCP |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| PyPI supply chain | 🔴 Full exposure — you own the dependency tree | ✅ Not applicable — no user-managed Python |
| Dependency management | 🔴 Your team patches, pins, audits | ✅ Vendor owns patching and SBOMs |
| .pth startup hooks | 🔴 Python runtime risk on every install | ✅ No local Python interpreter needed |
| Credential exposure | � API keys, secrets in `.env` files and env vars — prime exfil targets | 🟢 OAuth / Entra ID auth — no stored credentials on disk |
| Patching cadence | 🟠 Depends on your CI/CD | ✅ Vendor SLA |
| Incident response | 🔴 Your team scopes and remediates | 🟢 Shared responsibility with vendor |
| Customizability | 🟢 Fully customizable | 🟡 Limited to vendor's API surface |

**Key point:** Microsoft-hosted MCP servers (Sentinel, Graph, Azure, KQL Search, Learn) have zero user-managed Python dependencies. You consume a service endpoint — Microsoft owns the supply chain. For most security tooling use cases, this eliminates an entire threat class without meaningful functionality loss.

**Authentication model:** Microsoft-hosted MCP servers authenticate via OAuth / Entra ID — there are no API keys, secrets, or tokens stored on disk. Compare this to self-built MCP servers that typically require stored credentials (API keys in `.env` files, service account JSON files, connection strings in environment variables) — exactly the artifacts this malware was designed to harvest. With OAuth, there is nothing for a credential stealer to exfiltrate from the local filesystem.

### 2. Dependency Pinning and Lock Files

88% of the 2,337 packages that depend on litellm had version specs that accepted the malicious release. CI/CD pipelines pulling `latest` got compromised within minutes.

**Mitigations:**
- **Pin exact versions**: `litellm==1.82.6` not `litellm>=1.80`
- **Use lock files** (`pip-compile`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`) that capture the full dependency graph with hashes
- **Verify hashes**: `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`
- **Private PyPI mirrors** with approval gates (Azure Artifacts, Artifactory) — the 46-minute window between upload and quarantine is enough to poison a cache
- **Artifact signing**: PyPI now supports Sigstore attestations — verify them in pipelines

### 3. Python Runtime Hardening

The `.pth` file executes code on ANY Python interpreter startup — not just litellm imports. Most organizations don't monitor `site-packages` directories.

**Mitigations:**
- **Audit `.pth` files**: `find / -name "*.pth" -exec grep -l "import" {} \;` — legitimate `.pth` files rarely contain `import` statements
- **Set `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`** in production to prevent user site-packages from loading
- **Container isolation**: Run Python workloads in minimal containers (distroless/Alpine) with read-only filesystems — the malware writes to `~/.config/sysmon/` which fails on read-only
- **Monitor Python process counts**: The .pth fork bomb bug created hundreds of processes per minute (Query 24 detects this)

### 4. Credential Hygiene (Blast Radius Reduction)

Even if the malware executes, limit what it can steal:

| Mitigation | What It Prevents |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Managed identities** instead of stored credentials | Env var harvesting finds nothing — no `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` on disk |
| **Workload Identity Federation** (Azure/AWS/GCP) | No long-lived tokens on disk to exfiltrate |
| **Secret managers** (Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) | Secrets fetched at runtime, never written to `.env` files |
| **Short-lived tokens** (< 1 hour) | Stolen tokens expire before attacker can use them |
| **K8s bound service account tokens** | Default tokens are cluster-wide — bound tokens scope to namespace/audience |
| **SSH certificate-based auth** | No `id_rsa` private key to steal — certs expire automatically |
| **Git Credential Manager** over `.git-credentials` | No plaintext credentials on disk |
| **Docker credential helpers** over `~/.docker/config.json` | No plaintext registry tokens |

**Principle:** *Assume the workstation will eventually be compromised. When the malware runs `cat ~/.aws/credentials`, does it find anything?*

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Hardening

46,996 downloads in 46 minutes — most were automated pipelines, not humans.

- **Never `pip install` without a lock file** in production builds (Query 15 hunts for this)
- **Use `--no-deps`** when you control the dependency tree and install deps from your lock file
- **Separate build and runtime environments** — build containers should never have access to production secrets, K8s tokens, or cloud credentials
- **Network segmentation** — build environments should have restricted egress (allow PyPI/npm registries, deny everything else)
- **Ephemeral build agents** — destroy after each build, preventing persistence mechanisms from surviving

### 6. Detection Requirements

What to have in place BEFORE the next supply chain attack:

| Capability | Purpose | Coverage |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **MDE on developer workstations** | Process, file, network telemetry | Queries 1–29 in this pack |
| **DNS logging** (ASIM-normalized) | C2 domain resolution detection | Queries 6, 7, 8, 18, 19 |
| **Process command line auditing** | `pip install`, `uvx`, `kubectl` with full arguments | Queries 1, 2, 15, 23, 25 |
| **File integrity monitoring on `site-packages/`** | `.pth` file creation alerts | Queries 3, 4 |
| **Network monitoring for Python outbound** | Unusual POST destinations | Queries 5, 9, 20, 27 |
| **Container/K8s audit logging** | Privileged pod creation, secret enumeration | Query 23 |

### 7. The "46-Minute Window" Problem

The malicious version was live for 46 minutes before PyPI quarantined it. 46,996 downloads occurred. No scanner, advisory, or security tool caught it in time.

**Implications:**
- **Reactive security** (CVE scanning, advisory monitoring) is insufficient for supply chain attacks — the advisory comes *after* the damage
- **Proactive controls** (pinning, lock files, private mirrors, managed identities) are the only reliable preventive defense
- **Detection in depth** (this query pack) provides the forensic capability to scope impact after the fact
- **Vendor-hosted services** remove this entire attack class from your threat model for that component
